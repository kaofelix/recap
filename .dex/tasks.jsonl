{"id":"rnuxwitl","parent_id":null,"name":"Backend: return file contents instead of pre-computed diff","description":"Change backend to return old/new file contents so react-diff-viewer-continued can compute diffs with proper word-level highlighting.\n\n## Problem\nCurrent `get_file_diff` returns pre-computed diff hunks. We reconstruct old/new strings from these, but this loses context and the library can't do proper word-level diffing.\n\n## Solution\nAdd new command `get_file_contents(repoPath, commitId, filePath)` that returns:\n```rust\nstruct FileContents {\n    old_content: Option<String>,  // None if file was added\n    new_content: Option<String>,  // None if file was deleted  \n    is_binary: bool,\n}\n```\n\n## Changes\n1. Add `get_file_contents` function in `src-tauri/src/git.rs`\n2. Add Tauri command in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`\n3. Update `DiffView.tsx` to call new command\n4. Add TypeScript types for `FileContents`\n5. Can remove `get_file_diff` and related types if no longer needed\n\n## Reference\nSee GitHub Desktop screenshot for expected word-level highlighting behavior.","priority":1,"completed":true,"result":"Implemented get_file_contents backend command and updated frontend to use it.\n\n## Changes\n- Added FileContents struct: old_content (Option<String>), new_content (Option<String>), is_binary (bool)\n- Implemented get_file_contents in git.rs that reads blob content from commit tree and parent tree\n- Registered Tauri command in lib.rs\n- Updated DiffView.tsx to call get_file_contents instead of get_file_diff\n- Added TypeScript FileContents type in diff.ts\n- Added 4 backend tests for added/modified/deleted files and file-not-in-commit error\n- Updated all 12 DiffView tests to use new mock shape\n\n## Verification\n- 29 Rust tests pass (cargo test)\n- 93 frontend tests pass (bun run test)\n- Dev server running, ready for manual testing","metadata":{"commit":{"sha":"85bb458","message":"Add get_file_contents backend for proper diff library support","branch":"main","timestamp":"2026-02-08T22:21:18.996Z"}},"created_at":"2026-02-08T22:14:34.923Z","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:21:18.998Z","started_at":"2026-02-08T22:21:18.997Z","completed_at":"2026-02-08T22:21:18.998Z","blockedBy":[],"blocks":[],"children":[]}
